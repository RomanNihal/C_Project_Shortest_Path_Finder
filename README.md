# Shortest Path Finder 

This repository contains a **Shortest Path Finder** program written in **C**, developed as part of my **Algorithm Course**. The project helps users find the shortest path between two locations in a predefined map using a basic adjacency matrix representation.  

## Features  

- **Predefined Locations**:  
  - Dhanmondi  
  - Farmgate  
  - Shahbag  
  - Pilkhana  
  - Mogbazar  
  - Gulistan  
  - Sayedabad  
  - Motijheel  

- **Pathfinding Using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**:  
  - Efficiently computes the shortest path from a source to a destination.  
  - Displays the total distance and the path.  

- **Interactive User Input**:  
  - Select your current location.  
  - Choose your destination to calculate the shortest path.  

- **Basic User-Friendly Interface**:  
  - Simple navigation through numeric input.  
  - Intuitive display of results.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Language**: C  
- **Concepts**: Adjacency Matrix, Dijkstra's Algorithm
